## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Build the first useful end-to-end slice for symballist as an agent-first code retrieval tool. This slice should establish repo-local state, index a small set of supported source files, store symbol/search data locally, and return structured query results without requiring the full long-term architecture to be complete.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 The project can initialize repo-local symballist state in the target repository.
- [x] #2 The indexer can scan Python and HTML files and persist symbol-oriented records with a file-level fallback when parsing fails.
- [x] #3 A query command returns ranked results from local index data using lexical search, with room for optional embedding augmentation later.
- [x] #4 The implementation is structured so MCP exposure and incremental reindexing can be added without replacing the core storage and indexing model.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Replace the regex-based Python and HTML extraction path with tree-sitter-backed parsing while preserving file-level fallback behavior.
2. Add CLI support for targeting an explicit repository root via --root so symballist can be run against other repos without changing the implementation model.
3. Keep the SQLite schema and lexical query path stable so the parser upgrade remains an internal improvement.
4. Expand fixture and integration coverage to exercise typed Python functions, HTML ids, fallback parsing, and explicit root targeting.
5. Manually dogfood the CLI against another local repository after tests pass.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Scaffolded a zero-dependency Bun + TypeScript CLI slice with init, index, and query commands.

Added SQLite-backed storage, Python and HTML symbol extraction, and file-level fallback records.

Added fixture-based integration tests covering init, index, and lexical query.
