## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Build the first useful end-to-end slice for symballist as an agent-first code retrieval tool. This slice should establish repo-local state, index a small set of supported source files, store symbol/search data locally, and return structured query results without requiring the full long-term architecture to be complete.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 The project can initialize repo-local symballist state in the target repository.
- [x] #2 The indexer can scan Python and HTML files and persist symbol-oriented records with a file-level fallback when parsing fails.
- [x] #3 A query command returns ranked results from local index data using lexical search, with room for optional embedding augmentation later.
- [x] #4 The implementation is structured so MCP exposure and incremental reindexing can be added without replacing the core storage and indexing model.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Scaffold a Bun + TypeScript CLI project structure with a small command entrypoint and shared modules for init, index, and query.
2. Implement repo-local initialization that creates .symballist/ with config and SQLite database bootstrap hooks.
3. Add a first-pass indexer for Python and HTML files with symbol-first extraction interfaces and file-level fallback records.
4. Store indexed records in SQLite with a schema that supports lexical retrieval now and embeddings later.
5. Implement a query command that returns ranked lexical results from the local index.
6. Add a small fixture repo and integration-style tests that exercise init, index, and query end-to-end.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Scaffolded a zero-dependency Bun + TypeScript CLI slice with init, index, and query commands.

Added SQLite-backed storage, Python and HTML symbol extraction, and file-level fallback records.

Added fixture-based integration tests covering init, index, and lexical query.
